# Literate Programming

Literate Programming systems allow prose documentation to live
alongside code.

The following files are literate programming examples [boxen.org],
[website.org], [tools.org].

## [boxen.org]

This file serves as the basis for my customized boxen puppetry.

It is also the content behind the page at
https://jedcn.github.io/mac-config.

## [website.org]

This file defines the surrounding HTML, resources, and mechanisms for
building out a https://jedcn.github.io/mac-config.

## [tools.org]

This file defines a few core functions and interactions that let emacs
and Rake combined to do literate programming.
