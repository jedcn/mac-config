<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
I care about how my computer is configured.
</p>

<p>
I like magnifying any part of my screen so that I can easily show
things to my daughter.
</p>

<p>
I like controlling the applications that I am working with. I like
being able to easily expand, shrink, or dismiss them without much
effort.
</p>

<p>
There are certain programs I know how to use, and I'd like them to
automatically installed if they aren't.
</p>

<p>
And so, I've put some time into thinking about how to configure my
setup. This is what I've come up with.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1</span> What is this?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
As I am typing this, I am writing plain text in a single file
named <code>README.org</code>. However, this single file is versatile.
</p>

<p>
On one hand, it is part of a larger collection of files at
<a href="https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config">https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config</a>, and this means a formatted,
web accessible version of this single file is available here:
<a href="https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config/blob/master/README.org">README.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
But, this file also contains chunks of computer code, and these
chunks can be extracted into distinct files. These files play one
of three roles:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Some of the files contain HTML and serve as the basis of a
simple "website:" <a href="https://jedcn.github.io/mac-config">https://jedcn.github.io/mac-config</a>.
</li>
<li>Some of the files contain configuration in a language called
<a href="http://puppetlabs.com">puppet</a>. These play a role within a framework named <a href="https://boxen.github.com">boxen</a>, and
<b>are declarations</b> that can change my computer's configuration
as a result of running a command.
</li>
<li>Some of the files contain helper code in a language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">ruby</a>,
and these glue things together by extracting code, building up
the website, etc.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2</span> Wait, what's <code>.org</code>?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
<b>This</b> is a file named <code>README.org</code>. That extension, <code>.org</code>, means
that this is a plain text file that is structured following the
conventions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode">org-mode</a>, finally, org-mode is a part of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>.
</p>

<p>
A component of org-mode, named <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">babel</a>, serves as the basis for
interspersing chunks of code with text, and allowing these chunks
to be extracted.
</p>

<p>
If this seems strange to you, it probably is. From the meta point
of view, <b>this</b> is an experiment in using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate Programming</a> to
describe how I configure my computer.
</p>

<p>
Why document computer configuration at all? It stems from tension
between these two ideas:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I rarely configure a new computer, and yet,
</li>
<li>I deeply care about how my computer is configured.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The core motivation for documenting this in a Literate System
stems from wanting to capture prose descriptions (with links and
such) side-by-side my boxen configuration.
</p>

<p>
It is also motivated by the idea that I am sometimes asked, "How
did you configure your computer to do such-and-such?" I don't have
a great memory so I'd benefit from a self-describing
configuration.
</p>

<p>
The neat trick about Literate Source is that it can be dense
enough to create more than one artifact. This file <b>is</b> the puppet
configuration and it <b>is</b> the website and it <b>is</b> the glue code
that puts everything together.
</p>

<p>
So, why not make it so that a single document can help me share
with people?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.3</span> Who is this for?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<p>
I hope most of my prose configuration descriptions are accessible
to all mac users.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to boxen and puppet, what I have here works but I'm
not an expert by any means. If you've never seen a boxen
configuration before, you can surely see it here and see how
things are laid out.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-4"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.4</span> Who uses this?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-4">
<p>
I am the only explicit user of this configuration. I use it
outside of the context of any group or company, and I only have a
single computer.
</p>

<p>
Having worked with boxen for a small bit now, I think it's all
about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law">Metcalfe's Law</a> in the context of how many users and
computers you're working with. The more of either one you have the
more useful boxen will be.
</p>

<p>
And so, when it's just me, or just you, <b>I'd think twice about
using boxen itself.</b>
</p>

<p>
When it comes to this particular config, I can see how someone
could get an idea for what boxen is from it, or perhaps copy and
paste a few snippets into theirs.
</p>

<p>
However, no one should clone or fork this repository. Instead, if
you're looking to get started with boxen, then you should fork
<a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">boxen/our-boxen</a>.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1-5"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.5</span> Agenda</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-5">
<p>
We've got a general introduction to this document, and we
understand how it can be used, so what's left?
</p>

<p>
We'll lay things out as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>General Introduction (this)
</li>
<li>OSX Settings
</li>
<li>Dotfiles and Repositories
</li>
<li>Applications
</li>
<li>Command Line Utilities
</li>
</ol>

<p>
As we cover the content above, we'll intertwine prose with
puppetry (the language of boxen). The intent is to go straight at
what we're trying to achieve, and then, once we know where we want
to get to, we'll see how things fit together within the boxen
framework.
</p>

<p>
There's a bunch of mechanics underneath it all, and once this main
content has been covered, we'll move onto several supplementary
concepts:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Boxen, Puppetry, and File Layout
</li>
<li>How to Get Started with boxen
</li>
<li>Glue Code and Rake Tasks
</li>
<li>Keeping Things Up To Date
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Configuration</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
This section details my actual configuration.
</p>

<p>
We'll start with prose alongside puppet, and later on I will
explain how everything comes together in the Administrativia
section.
</p>

<p>
All of the configuration that you're about to see is functional. It
defines "rules" about how my computer should be configured. This
includes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Which system settings should be in place
</li>
<li>Which repositories should be cloned (say, dotfiles)
</li>
<li>Which links should be created (saa, to those cloned repositories)
</li>
<li>Which applications should be installed
</li>
<li>Which homebrew installs should be performed
</li>
<li>Which git settings should be configured
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The nature of puppet is that it "makes things match" the rules, and
so, if there's a rule that says 'Chrome needs to be installed' then
puppet will check to see if Chrome is present, and install it if it
is not. <b>If</b> Chrome already is installed, then puppet does nothing.
</p>

<p>
This means that a first run of boxen might take 30 or 40 minutes
while dozens of programs are downloaded and installed, but
subsequent runs take just a few seconds.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1</span> OSX Settings</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<p>
I've started with the idea of configuring OSX because I think it's
the most compelling reason for using boxen. I can imagine a
situation where I use boxen <b>just</b> for the ability to automatically
configure OSX, and nothing more.
</p>

<p>
That said, boxen itself doesn't know about OSX, but you can use a
module named <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-osx">puppet-osx</a>, and it provides the ability to do things
like:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Map CAPS LOCK to CTRL.
</li>
<li>Make your key presses repeat very quickly.
</li>
<li>Make it so that holding CTRL and scrolling on your trackpad will
magnify the screen underneath the mouse pointer.
</li>
<li>Switch your shell to ZSH.
</li>
<li>Automatically hide the dock.
</li>
<li>Remove clutter from the dock by making it only contain running
apps.
</li>
<li>Setup a message on your lock screen to provides your contact
information if your laptop is found.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
All of these things are tweakable by hand, but using boxen lets you
get going in a flash, and lets you change things (say, the repeat
rate) in a controlled manner.
</p>

<p>
If you're working in this area, <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-osx">the main README of the puppet-osx</a>
project is critical to understanding these settings.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2</span> Dotfiles and Repositories</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
I generally use <a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/">dotfiles</a>, and I specifically use <a href="https://github.com/andsens/homeshick">homeshick</a> with my
own <a href="https://github.com/jedcn/dot-org-files">dot-org-files</a>.
</p>

<p>
In this area, boxen enables you to:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Declare which repositories should be cloned on the
machine. These don't have to limited to dotfiles, for example, I
like to have <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/">oh-my-zsh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">z</a>.
</li>
<li>Setup links from your home directory to those repositories.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, you don't have to use boxen to setup links if the system
you're using has this capability, but in my case I let boxen do the
work even though homeshick can handle it.
</p>

<p>
I expect that I'll have dozens and dozens of repositories cloned
onto my machine. My general game plan is to put most of my
repositories underneath <code>/project</code>, and to make a special place for
repositories that are used to bootstrap my shell (dot files,
oh-my-zsh, z, etc). These "bootstrap repositories" live underneath
<code>/opt/init-src</code>, which I picked because it's so close to boxen's
home, <code>/opt/boxen</code>.
</p>

<p>
I plan on using boxen to only manage the ones at <code>/opt/init-src</code>.
</p>

<p>
The puppetry below creates a directory, and clones several
repositories:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>jedcn/dot-org-files
</li>
<li>jedcn/emacs-setup
</li>
<li>robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
</li>
<li>rupa/z
</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre>
<code class='language-ruby'>class people::jedcn::repositories {

  $my_init_src = '/opt/init-src'

  file { $my_init_src:
    ensure =&gt; directory,
    mode   =&gt; 0644,
  }

  repository { "${my_init_src}/dot-org-files":
    source  =&gt; 'jedcn/dot-org-files',
    require =&gt; File[$my_init_src]
  }

  repository { "${my_init_src}/emacs-setup":
    source  =&gt; 'jedcn/emacs-setup',
    require =&gt; File[$my_init_src]
  }

  repository { "${my_init_src}/z":
    source  =&gt; 'rupa/z',
    require =&gt; File[$my_init_src]
  }

  repository { "${my_init_src}/oh-my-zsh":
    source  =&gt; 'robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh',
    require =&gt; File[$my_init_src]
  }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
And this next puppetry creates several links so that the files
inside of those repositories appear in places relative to my home
directory.
</p>

<p>
The "require" attributes instruct puppet to make sure the main
directory and repositories are cloned before the links are created:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre>
<code class='language-ruby'>class people::jedcn::links {

  $my_init_src = '/opt/init-src'

  file { "/Users/${luser}/.zshrc":
    ensure  =&gt; link,
    mode    =&gt; '0644',
    target  =&gt; "${my_init_src}/dot-org-files/home/.zshrc",
    require =&gt; Repository["${my_init_src}/dot-org-files"],
  }

  file { "/Users/${luser}/.oh-my-zsh":
    ensure  =&gt; link,
    target  =&gt; "${my_init_src}/oh-my-zsh",
    require =&gt; Repository["${my_init_src}/oh-my-zsh"],
  }

  file { "/Users/${luser}/.slate":
    ensure  =&gt; link,
    mode    =&gt; '0644',
    target  =&gt; "${my_init_src}/dot-org-files/home/.slate",
    require =&gt; Repository["${my_init_src}/dot-org-files"],
  }
}
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.3</span> Applications</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<p>
Next up, after dot-files and repositories have been figured out, we
figure out applications like Chrome and Firefox.
</p>

<p>
You can use boxen to install the applications that you work
with. In turn, boxen relies on modules to install applications, and
here are a few examples of modules that I use:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-firefox">puppet-firefox</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-chrome">puppet-chrome</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-slate">puppet-slate</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After you declare that you want to have an application, like
firefox, you run the command <code>boxen</code> and the application will
"just" appear in your Applications folder. This means installing
applications is reduced to writing a few lines of code rather than
visiting websites, downloading <code>.dmg</code> files, and running
installers.
</p>

<p>
However, you still have the ability to install an application
manually, so which path should you choose?
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-1-2-3-1" name="sec-1-2-3-1"></a>Boxen vs. Manual Install<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-3-1">
<p>
Not all puppet-modules are created equally. This is especially so
when it comes to applications: some of them call out older
versions of applications. These may no longer work, or there may
be newer versions available.
</p>

<p>
Also, in some cases, you need to install an application via the
AppStore to get the correctly licensed version of it. This
happened to me with 1Password.
</p>

<p>
And so, I make a choice with each application between using boxen
vs. installing by hand. In general, if I can get it through boxen,
that's what I'd prefer.
</p>

<p>
After all of that, let's talk about the applications that are
installed as part of this puppet config.

Firefox, and their development versions.

but this puppetry allows me to put all of the packages I want in an
array, run a single <code>boxen</code> command, and then I'm done.
</p>

<p>
As I scan through what's below, I recognize that the majority of
packages are simple, standard installs. It's like you typed <code>brew
    install ag</code>, for example.
</p>

<p>
However, you can install with options, as I do with emacs. I
learned about these in a post titled <a href="http://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/08/21/color-themes-redux/">Color Themes: Redux</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two quick notes in regards to puppet:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Homebrew is the standard package provider for puppetry within
boxen. This means that if you declare a <code>package</code> (as seen below)
then the <code>provider</code> defaults to <code>homebrew</code>.
</li>
<li>If you install <code>cask</code> before you have <code>emacs</code>, then homebrew
tries to grab <code>emacs</code> (without the options I like). And so&#x2013; you
can use <code>require</code> attributes to manage dependencies with boxen.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are the packages I like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre>
<code class='language-ruby'>class people::jedcn::homebrew {
  $homebrew_packages = [
			'ag',
			'tmux',
			'tree',
			'wget',
			'zsh',
			]

  package { $homebrew_packages: }

  package { 'cask':
    ensure  =&gt; present,
    require =&gt; Package['emacs'],
  }

  package { 'emacs':
    ensure          =&gt; present,
    install_options =&gt; [
      '--cocoa',
      '--srgb'
    ],
  }
}
</code></pre>

Boxen uses a package named <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-git">puppet-git</a> to manage git configuration
options.
</p>

<p>
I manually set my <code>user.email</code> and <code>user.name</code> when I first started
using my computer, and after some bootstrapping, I got to the point
where I could have boxen set my <code>core.editor</code>, and that's what's
below.
</p>

<p>
I hope to flesh this out in the future.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
So far we've had the luxury of just looking at puppet configuration
and presuming that it somehow fits together. In this section, we'll
now consider where files are placed, how they interact, and how
boxen is run.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> Puppetry and File Layout</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
Boxen pays attention to the puppetry in this project on the basis
of my user login: <code>jedcn</code>. The system allows for you to call out a
specific configuration for a user by placing a file at
<code>modules/people/manifests/$USER.pp</code>.
</p>

<p>
And so, I can put content at <code>modules/people/manifests/jedcn.pp</code>
that will be examined each time I run <code>boxen</code>.
</p>

<p>
When I write puppet, I do my best to group declarations into
distinct files, and so, my entry point only includes other files:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre>
<code class='language-ruby'>class people::jedcn {
  include people::jedcn::applications
  include people::jedcn::git
  include people::jedcn::homebrew
  include people::jedcn::links
  include people::jedcn::osx_config
  include people::jedcn::repositories
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
These <code>include</code> statements invoke puppetry in other files, at
locations that match up with the directories if you replace the
<code>::</code> with <code>/</code>. As an example, you can find
<code>people::jedcn::applications</code> at
<code>modules/people/manifests/jedcn/applications.pp</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.2</span> How to Get Started</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
I was confused when I first started using Boxen. I went to the
website, <a href="https://boxen.github.com/">https://boxen.github.com/</a>, but didn't know what to do
next.
</p>

<p>
I suspect that most boxen users do so within the context of a
company, and so, someone has already laid down some basic boxen
infrastructure and then subsequent users get told the first few
steps to bootstrap themselves by someone at the company.
</p>

<p>
If you are like me, and you don't have that luxury, so it may be
helpful to understand what I did:
</p>

<p>
I logged into github.com and forked <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">boxen/our-boxen</a>, and now I had
<a href="https://github.com/jedcn/our-boxen">jedcn/our-boxen</a>. Going forward your fork will contain your
configuration (or the configuration of your team) and
boxen/our-boxen can serve as its its "upstream". This fact will
allow your fork to pull in policy and security and code changes
from the boxen project.
</p>

<p>
I changed the name of my fork because I had trouble explaining
"our-boxen" to my friends. They didn't know what boxen was and
they didn't understand why I was using the word "our" in a
scenario where I was only managing <b>my own</b> mac config. I picked
the name "mac-config", and the new home of my boxen repository is
<a href="https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config/">jedcn/mac-config</a>.
</p>

<p>
At any rate, now that your fork exists, the next step is to get it
cloned locally and then bootstrap boxen. The first boxen run will
install the defaults that Github/Boxen promotes.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-1-3-2-1" name="sec-1-3-2-1"></a>Bootstrapping<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-3-2-1">
<p>
Boxen has just a couple pre-requisites that need to be met:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>xCode should be installed
</li>
<li>Your boxen fork should be cloned to <code>/opt/boxen/repo</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you've got these, you can run <code>boxen</code>. If you're down with
puppet, this is apparently very similar to a masterless scenario
where you're running <code>puppet apply</code>. I'm not down with puppet, so
I think of it as effectively "reifying" your boxen config.
</p>

<p>
The following commands should do the trick:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">xcode-select --install
sudo mkdir -p /opt/boxen
sudo chown ${USER}:staff /opt/boxen
git clone https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config /opt/boxen/repo
/opt/boxen/repo/script/boxen
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
When the first boxen run completed I didn't have any of the
configuration that you've seen so far. Instead, I had whatever
was in my clone, and this matched boxen/our-boxen on the day I
forked it. So, what does your first boxen run get you?
</p>

<p>
The official answer is here: <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen#what-you-get">boxen/our-boxen#what-you-get</a>.
</p>

<p>
When it comes to ruby and node, what I saw was that I had several
installations via <a href="https://github.com/wfarr/nodenv">nodenv</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">rbenv</a>. These were located at
<code>/opt/rubies</code> and <code>/opt/boxen/nodenv/versions</code>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">$ ls /opt/rubies
1.9.3      1.9.3-p545 2.0.0      2.0.0-p451 2.1.0      2.1.1      2.1.2

$ ls /opt/boxen/nodenv/versions
v0.10    v0.10.31 v0.6     v0.6.20  v0.8     v0.8.26
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Until now, I always used <code>rvm</code> rather than <code>rbenv</code>, and I'd never
used <code>nodenv</code>. Further&#x2013; when it comes to node&#x2013; I doubt I'll
ever need any version that's less than 0.10, but I didn't sweat
this, nor try to change it.
</p>

<p>
My thinking here is that what matters is ruby and node, not
necessarily one tool for getting ruby or node over
another. Further, I don't mind having a few extra rubies or nodes
around.
</p>

<p>
Finally&#x2013; even though ruby and node are some of my goto
programming languages&#x2013; I can still see serious value in using
boxen to manage OSX Configuration and Applications <b>even if</b> the
users of a computer <b>never use</b> ruby or node.

<p>
This first <code>boxen</code> run took about 25-30 minutes. However, once
your initial run is done, then you can run boxen at any time by
typing <code>boxen</code>. If there's nothing to do, a run can be completed
in as little as 10 seconds.
</p>

<p>
And then you can get into a flow where you make a change to your
puppet configuration, run boxen, and see what happens.

<p>
Earlier on I said,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>this</b> is an experiment in using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate Programming</a> to describe
 how I configure my computer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And then I said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The neat trick about Literate Source is that it can be dense
enough to create more than one artifact. This file <b>is</b> the
puppet configuration and it <b>is</b> the website and it <b>is</b> the glue
code that puts everything together.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And then I stopped talking about it.
</p>

<p>
Let's revisit these ideas now that we've been through the majority
of the puppet configuration.
</p>

<p>
This single document <b>is</b> code.
</p>

<p>
And it is English prose.
</p>

<p>
It is puppet.
</p>

<p>
It is ruby.
</p>

<p>
And it is html.
</p>

<p>
It is available here
<a href="https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config/blob/master/README.org">https://github.com/jedcn/mac-config/blob/master/README.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
And here: <a href="http://jedcn.github.io/mac-config">http://jedcn.github.io/mac-config</a>.
</p>

<p>
This is possible because code snippets, spanning any language, are
embedded into this document. Most of them have associated
directives that indicate how they should be extracted.
</p>

<p>
Let's talk more about that.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-4-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.1</span> Content Extraction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">
<p>
This single <code>.org</code> file can be extracted into many component
pieces. What comes out of the file? The pieces are puppetry, web
files, and ruby:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>*.pp files (for boxen runs)
</li>
<li>HTML files (for building a static, descriptive site)
</li>
<li>A <code>Rakefile</code> and supporting <code>./rakelib/*.rake</code> files.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The extraction process is powered by ruby and emacs, if you have
this repository cloned, you can type <code>rake tangle</code> and this single
file will be unpacked.
</p>

<p>
How does this work? Whenever you run Rake, you need to start with
the <code>Rakefile</code>.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-1-4-1-1" name="sec-1-4-1-1"></a>The Rakefile<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-1-1">
<p>
The first role played by the <code>Rakefile</code> is its mere
existence. When you run a <code>rake -W</code> or a <code>rake -T</code> rake comes to
life and starts looking "up" until it finds a <code>Rakefile</code>.
</p>

<p>
From there, it looks down in the <code>./rakelib</code> directory for files
ending in <code>.rake</code>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the <code>Rakefile</code>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>defines a function named <code>run</code> which enhances standard command
execution so that you can get access to stdout, stderr, and the
process' signal.
</li>
<li>It defines a task named <code>:emacs_installed</code>. This allows other
tasks to call it out as a pre-requisite and serves as asserting a
pre-condition that we "have" emacs installed.
</li>
<li>Calls out <code>:tangle</code> (defined elsewhere) as the default
task. You can invoke the default task by typing <code>rake</code> without
any other arguments. Tangle is nomenclature from Donald Knuth&#x2013;
I've been using the term "extract" synonymously.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ruby">def run(c)
  require 'open3'
  _stdin, stdout, stderr = Open3.popen3(c)
  [ stdout.gets, stderr.gets, $?.to_i ]
end

task :emacs_installed do
  location = `which emacs`
  raise 'Unable to find emacs' if location.empty?
end

task default: :tangle
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Which leads to the question, <b>What's :tangle?</b>
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-1-4-1-2" name="sec-1-4-1-2"></a>Tangling (extracting) README.org into distinct files<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-1-2">
<p>
A file named <code>./rakelib/tangle.rake</code> defines the <code>:tangle</code> task,
and this extracts all of the code snippets in <code>README.org</code> to
various files.
</p>

<p>
While emacs is a text editor, it is also a tool that can execute
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">elisp</a>. Further, if you run emacs in "batch mode," it does not
start the text editing user interface it's common associated with.
</p>

<p>
And so, below, you'll see a ruby function that contains a brief
bit of elisp which uses org-babel functions to extract the snippets.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-ruby">def tangle_file_using_emacs(file)
  args = '--no-init-file --no-site-file --batch'
  tangle_elisp =
    %Q|(progn (require 'ob-tangle) (org-babel-tangle-file \\"#{file}\\"))|
  command = %Q|emacs #{args} --eval "#{tangle_elisp}"|
  _stdout, stderr, status = run(command)
  puts stderr unless status == 0
end

desc 'tangle literate source into puppet'
task :tangle =&gt; :emacs_installed do
  tangle_file_using_emacs('README.org')
end
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
And so, that's how all of the puppetry that you've seen above is
unpacked.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-1-4-1-3" name="sec-1-4-1-3"></a>Flow<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-4-1-3">
<p>
What this means is that I take the following steps when I want to
change my computer configuration:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I revisit <code>README.org</code> and I look for where the new
configuration might fit.
</li>
<li>I add a prose description of what I am looking to do.
</li>
<li>I update a snippet of puppet
</li>
<li>I then jump to a terminal and run <code>rake &amp;&amp; boxen</code>
</li>
<li>The <code>rake</code> command extracts the contents into the puppet files,
and the boxen command reifies the puppet config.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once I like what I see, I commit both the <code>README.org</code> and the
associated puppet file. This means generated code is commit to
source control. The files are small, and they don't get out of
sync, so I haven't had a problem with it. I briefly considered
adding the puppet files to a <code>.gitignore</code> and keeping them in
only one location, but decided I'd rather have everything in
source even if there's a chance they get out of sync.
</p>
</div>
</li></ol>

This <code>README.org</code> file can be transformed into HTML using an
export mechanism that is built into org-mode.
</p>

<p>
The content is effectively put into HTML within a <code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code>,
and then it's inserted into a basic template from
HTML5Boilerplate.
</p>

<p>
This is achieved by minimally converting the HTML5Boilerplate HTML
into ERB and by writing a rake task that can download and unpack
an HTML5Boilerplate zip.

Next, I wrote up Rake-based instructions for building up static
web content that serves as a website.
</p>

<p>
This static content will be hosted on Github Pages, and so, the
following makes it so that the directory <code>gh-pages/</code> is created

There's also a part that knows about <a href="http://www.initializr.com">http://www.initializr.com</a>,
and how to download a copy of HTML5 Boiler Plate. This comes in a
ZIP. These instructions know how to unpack the ZIP and put parts
of it in the right places.

This following information, while valuable to me, didn't rightly
fit in anywhere, and so it landed here until it can be sorted out.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-1">
<p>
This repository is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">boxen/our-boxen</a>, and so, while I've
done a bunch of customization, I'd like to stay up-to-date with the
original repository to get fixes, security patches, etc.
</p>

<p>
This is setup by creating a remote named "upstream" that points to
<a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">boxen/our-boxen</a>. Then the master branch from this repo is merged in
like regular.
</p>

<h4 id="sec-1-5-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.5.2</span> Manual Installs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">
<p>
I installed the following Software manually:
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-1-5-2-1" name="sec-1-5-2-1"></a>1Password<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-5-2-1">
<p>
I got this from the AppStore. I did because I couldn't figure out
how to license it, otherwise.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-1-5-2-2" name="sec-1-5-2-2"></a>Little Snitch<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-5-2-2">
<p>
I tried installing this via puppet. I tried a provider of <code>appdmg</code>
and <code>pkgdmg</code>, and neither did I was expected. I started with
<code>appdmg</code>, and this put both the Installer and Uninstaller in my
Applications&#x2013; but that's not what I want. I want to run the
Installer <b>once</b> and then have "Little Snitch Configuration" be
the only thing that's in my Applications.
</p>

<p>
Anyway&#x2013; I gave up and I downloaded it from this URL and
double-clicked to the install:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.obdev.at/downloads/littlesnitch/LittleSnitch-3.5.1.dmg">http://www.obdev.at/downloads/littlesnitch/LittleSnitch-3.5.1.dmg</a>
</p>

<p>
The install required a reboot, and after that, it immediately
started going.

<p>
I tried getting onepassword here (with <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-onepassword">puppet-onepassword</a>), but I
couldn't figure out the licensing. Specifically, after a boxen run
it was in trial mode and looking for a license file. But, I didn't
have a license because I bought 1Password through the
AppStore.
</p>

<p>
After 15 minutes of mucking around, I installed through the
AppStore, and things worked just fine.

<p>
Near as I can tell, if you try to get something running with boxen
and then you give up and remove the puppetry, you'll still have
whatever-didnt-install-the-way-you-wanted installed, and so, you
can manually remove that thing but you should also remove
something called a "receipt" that can be found in the <code>/var/db</code>
directory, for example:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>sudo rm .puppet_compressed_app_installed_1Password\ 5</code>
</li>
<li><code>sudo rm /var/db/.puppet_appdmg_installed_LittleSnitch</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I learned about receipts in the <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/blob/master/docs/faq.md">official boxen FAQ</a>.

<li><a id="sec-1-5-3-3" name="sec-1-5-3-3"></a>What does a module do?<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-5-3-3">
<p>
If you've found a puppet module that you'd like to check out, the
first place to look is in the file named <code>manifests/init.pp</code>. I
believe this is the entry point for all modules. You can usually
see other files that are included into it or URLs, version
numbers, and configuration options.

<li><a id="sec-1-5-3-4" name="sec-1-5-3-4"></a>Where do you find modules?<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-5-3-4">
<p>
Modules can be defined anywhere, and the most popular ones are
underneath the Boxen Github repository:
<a href="https://github.com/boxen/">https://github.com/boxen/</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can search for ones that are formally part of that
organization by visiting the link above and typing the name of the
application into to the "Filters."
